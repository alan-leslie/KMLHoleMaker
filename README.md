Java program to convert a polygon with holes in it to a polygon with no holes. 
Needed because at the time polygons in google maps could not be displayed with holes.
For example the pentagon has to be modelled as a polygon with 12 sides (5 outer, 5 inner and two sides connecting from inner to outer) to be able to display the pentagon with a courtyard.
Note: built with netbeans.
